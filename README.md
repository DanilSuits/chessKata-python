## Introduction

> The original challenge was raised by Peter Siebel

> In a variant of chess called Fischer Random Chess, you start the
board in a (partially) random position according to the following
rules. You place the pawns in their normal starting positions. Then
you place the white pieces in the first rank in a random arrangement
excepting that:

> * The bishops are each on different colored squares.
> * The king is somewhere between the two rooks.

> Then the black pieces are placed in there corresponding places on the
other side of the board.

> Write a function (method, procedure, whatever) that returns a
randomly generated legal arrangement of the eight white pieces.
