Another quick refactoring to make the next change easy.

The implementation I'm working towards is the same I
used in the past -- treating the seed as a squashed
encoding of _hints_ that are used to compute the positions
of specific pieces.

So for the bishops, I tease out the hints so that I can work
with them more directly.
