This one is my least favorite steps.  I find myself really
wishing hard that I had used BBQNNRKR as my initial example
as I did years ago.

But trying to get the previous examples to work after
starting with BBRKRQNN is seems really twisted.  It
is doable, but perhaps the exercise of trying to
step through things the wrong way will help.

Start with a quick GREEN, so that we can be sure that
subsequent changes aren't ruining code paths that work.
