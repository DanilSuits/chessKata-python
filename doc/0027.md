With more attention, an easy green.

Looking back, I somewhat suspect I also got distracted
by a change of plan in what examples to use -- I had been
considering jumping directly from (0,4) to (0,16), changed
my mind to include an explicit example for the input 4, and
then specified the example carelessly.

The implementation was fine, but in the confusion I couldn't
as easily see what I had done.  The timebox ran out, so I
just reverted and down shifted to a slower cadence.
