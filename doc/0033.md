# Overfitting

One of the properties of the Fischer chess rows
is that a mirrored Fischer position is a also
a valid Fischer position -- that has to be true
because the black starting row is a mirrored
image of the white starting row.

But if we happen to change our implemention
to return mirrored rows, what happens?

Our property based tests are all perfectly
happy whether we are looking at the black
pieces or the white pieces.

But our example based tests _fail_, because
they are over fitted to one implementation.
These tests are get in the way... not of 
pure refactoring, which should continue to
have the same observable results, but in
the way of changes to the implementation
that happen to support a different mapping
of inputs to outputs.
