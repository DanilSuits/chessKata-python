At this point, the test should be easy to pass, because the two
times index logic should also work for inputs `2` and `3`

... And it is.  Gravity still works.

Note that this is still a properly calibrated test; I went from
RED to GREEN by making a change to the production code only
(basically by switching from a broken implementation to a correct
implementation).
