Extending the example with two more choices; perhaps a big jump, but since
it should be easy to make the tests pass in one swing, I give it a try
... it promptly blows up in my face, so I scale the change back, and try
make sure I can get the easier of the two checks to work.

The real fault turns out to be pretty simple; because I thought
the change would be easy, I was careless about getting the example
specification right, and it blew up in my face.
