# Testing the functional core

Because we are now injecting the logic that controls the seed
of the random number generator, we can replace that logic with
something deterministic, and then write tests that rely upon
that deterministic behavior.

Tests of the functional core can be written in a number of styles;
at the time this kata was introduced, most of us were thinking
in the language of specific examples that would drive an implementation.

Example based tests are very much a
_simplest thing that could possibly work_ approach: you force
the implementation to progress by constraining it to produce
a specific new result.

Property based tests are a less prescriptive; they describe the
new constraint to satisfy, without providing a lot of information
in how to do it.

In this particular example, the property that you need to express
is coverage: do we get all of the different results that we expect
for the given range of inputs.  In other words, it's a collective
property that holds over a number of different inputs considered
together, rather than creating a one to one mapping.

One thing that makes property tests look hard is that you are
investigating a constraint on the entire range of behaviors, which
gives the impression of a big bang test -- suddenly you need to
throw everything out and draw the entire owl.
