# Functional Core, Imperative Shell

At the time, I was aware that testing random was hard, but that
testing something derived from random was straight forward.  So
I just skipped on ahead to deterministic part.

We were missing the language of the [functional core and the
imperative shell][bernhardt_2012].  

We almost knew it; we knew about separating the UI from the model, 
but still only in the superficial form of "thin layer where it is 
hard to test, real work where it is easy to test".

## Input Values

![An implementation of random() that hardcodes the answer][xkcd_random_number]

Producing a "random" number is analogous to reading a character from `stdin`
or reading a time from the system clock.  They are all _input values_

The problem that we are having right now is that the API we've selected
doesn't actually provide any input affordances; we can't control the
"random number", being used, which means that we cannot force the implementation
to explore the space of solutions.

So we ought to have been thinking about the source of the randomness as
something that gets passed into the module, so that we can replace it
with a test double when we need deterministic behavior.

## Plan of Attack

So the basic idea is that we'll spike a new implementation (with its own
tests) based on this idea, and see how we get on.
