# Property based tests

We can use properties to further constrain the valid output.

```python
    def pieces_satisfy_specification(self, pieces):
        self.pieces_are_truthy(pieces)
        self.has_all_pieces(pieces)
        self.has_bishops_on_opposite_colors(pieces)
        self.has_king_between_rooks(pieces)
```

But this demonstrated an oddity that we were having trouble
with at the time -- you can add additional constraints to
the output, but that doesn't budge you off of the trivial
implementation.
