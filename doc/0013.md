# Property Tests

By isolating the functional core from the random number generator, we
simplify the problem of ensuring that the shuffled pieces appear with
the correct distribution; we just need to ensure that the core respects
the distribution emitted by the random number generator.

A straightforward way to do that is to ensure that we have a injection
from integers in the appropriate range to the shuffled boards.  Since
there are 960 different boards, we can ensure that numbers in the range
[0,960) map to a unique board, and then worry about the problem
of mapping a random distribution to numbers in that range independently.

Because 960 seeds is a relatively small number, and generation of
any given board is cheap, it makes sense to simply enumerate all
of the seeds in that range, and ensure that each produces a different
board.  Any duplicates are easily detected, because the set of observed
arrangements will be too small if there are duplicates.

Exhaustive enumeration may be cost prohibitive when the number of
possibilities is very large.  In that case, an approach where we
use the test harness to randomly sample the possible inputs, and
check the results against each other may be effective -- you can
dial the number of discrete checks up or down for each test to
increase the required confidence in the test.
