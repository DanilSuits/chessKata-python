# Rework Example Tests

Well, that's what I get for being cavalier about testing my examples
I forgot to actually check that my "expected" values satisfied the
problem constraints; I chose an example that didn't actually match
the specification, and then calibrated the test by copying the
same mistake into production.

Then I wondered why I couldn't trivially pass the property tests,
and decided to defer them for a moment, rather than recognizing 
why the test was wrong.

Remedy: revert the tests and start over.

Note that when I revert the tests, I'm able to leave the current
_implementation_ in place, which is nice -- I'll be able to introduce
a broken test on the next run, and then fix it.
