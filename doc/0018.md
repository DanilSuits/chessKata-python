We can then remove duplication to advance toward the core of the
problem - taking the index and generating from it a permutation
of positions that satisfy the constraints.

This puts me into a position of having two code blocks, one for
the shuffle, one for the mapping.  The blocks help me to separate
the ideas in my head.
