Oh hooray, python has a library that does the next bit of
magic for me.

OK, the basic idea is that the hint that we've retrieved
for the king rook king tuple is used to look up _some_
arrangement of 3 empty squares out of the available 6.
The itertools method gives us the arrangements in a
fixed order, so indexing into the list produces a consistent
result.

So we pick one arrangement of indexes, use those to
lookup into the remaining empty squares, assign those
to the king and rooks, and then remove those squares
from the list of empties so that they are not re-used.

This should give us an implementation that will generate
many boards.

The tests are green, so we can give it a try.
