# Property Tests

One way to avoid the Draw the Owl problem in property tests is to
control the range of inputs that the test applies to.

In this case, where we are looking at an integer range, we can simply
move in steps.

First, check that the property holds over a small portion of the input
space.

Then iterate, exanding the input coverage bit by bit until all of
the possibilities are covered.
