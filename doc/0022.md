_The point_, as they sometimes say in chess analysis.

There was duplication hidden in the positioning of the
first rook originally, which is that it was taking which
ever of the first two positions the first bishop didn't.

In other words, I had always been sneaking it into the
first available square.

I had to proceed a bit carefully, because I can't let the
other _bishop_ slip into that corner square, which is
of the wrong color.
