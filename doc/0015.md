The final piece in the mix is arranging that I can focus on
the introducing the implementation without getting tangled
in the test calibration.

There's a bit of duplication of idea present here; I'm using
the same values on both sides of the test harness to track
which cases are already covered.  `Don't Repeat Yourself`
normally encourages the programmer to remove precisely this
sort of duplication; here, it's just part of the scaffolding:
the duplication will be eliminated by eliminating the scaffolding
altogether.
