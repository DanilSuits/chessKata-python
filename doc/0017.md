With the rows split out into two parts, it was easier
for me to see that I could just fix the positions of
the pieces that I don't need for the moment trivially.

That is to say, the single string became a pair of
substrings, which in turn became a pair of arrays
of positions in a single reference string.

In this commit, I've deliberately left this particular
refactoring done half way through.

The new function, of course, is just a straight lift
from my earlier work.  The "simplest thing" in its more
common meaning -- a cut and paste of some code that
I found somewhere else.
