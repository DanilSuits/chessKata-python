I inline the logic for mapping the piece names primarily because
I don't like the name of it.  The experiment I copied from was
written long before my current naming sensibilities evolved,
and the original wasn't particularly pythonic anyway

I don't actually have a better name yet, and that isn't really the
point of the current exercise, so I solve the dilemma by refactoring
the problem away.

The method wasn't part of the published API (as demonstrated by
the fact that no tests failed), so no harm no foul.
