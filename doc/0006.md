# Testing the imperative shell

General answer: don't.

Confidence in the imperative shell comes not from testing it thoroughly, but instead
by keeping it so mind bendingly simple that it can't possibly break.

In this specialized case, we can apparently get away with it, because the shell's
only task is the seeding of the random number generator, and we don't get interference
effects when that operation occurs multiple times.

Because the responsibility of this method is implemented so simply, if there were
a problem I would remove the tests for this method from the unit test suite rather
than trying to "fix" it.

It happens in this case that the tests are effectively free (being left over from
earlier work).
