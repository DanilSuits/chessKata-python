Finally, we're at the point were I'm ready to make the easy
change.  But first, I need my failing tests...

Interesting to note that test_different_seeds_give_different_boards
doesn't fail reliably; it should be passing about 1 time in 6 right
now even though the implementation is broken.  If I were drawing
three candidates to compare, rather than 2, it would have broken; or
if I had a loop in the check to ensure that more than one random
combination was exercised.
